Hello! Iâ€™m **Mahendra Pawar**, **Lighting Technical Supervisor** with over 7 years of experience at DNEG.

My professional journey began in the dynamic world of visual effects, where I initially engaged in creative work. However, I soon realised my strengths leaned more toward the technical and managerial sides rather than purely creative tasks. This insight inspired me to transition from working inside software to working on softwareâ€”focusing on building, optimising, and managing technology solutions.

This shift has fueled my passion for technology and product management, with an emphasis on AI and automation to transform business operations. As an aspiring AI product manager, I am actively learning, embracing challenges, and collaborating with forward-thinking professionals who share my vision for innovation and smart technology integration. I am eager to contribute my unique perspective, blending technical know-how with management enthusiasm, to create meaningful impact in the product space.

### ðŸš€ What I do
- Design and manage AI-driven products that solve real-world problems
- Build and optimize automation tools to enhance efficiency across workflows
- Lead cross-functional teams through the full product lifecycle

### ðŸŒ± Goals & Aspirations
- Transition into a full-time product management role
- Develop innovative solutions that drive measurable business impact
- Grow as a leader & Founder who blends technical expertise with strategic vision
